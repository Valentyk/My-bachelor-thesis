Materials and code that I use for my bachelor thesis - electrostatics and magnetostatics on a hypersphere

Scripts that are in folder called "scripts" ( :) ) are unfortunately not well documented (sometimes not at all).

Most of my scripts are used to decompose funciton on the hypersphere (sphere in four dimensions) into eigenfuncitons of laplace operator. In other words hyperspherical harmonics (the most interesting are the Gegenbauer polynomials that are used).

I also have srctiprs that sallow me to visualize the functions on hypersphere. My script allows me to plot any hyperspherical function to 3d space using hyperstereographical projeciton. The resulting image can look something like this:

The function shown is the function of $\zeta$ where $\zeta$ is one of the hyperspehrical coordinates ($\phi$, $\theta$, $\zeta$).

The plot in the picture carries some kind of numerical artefacts that are visible especially in the yellow parts of the plot. If I have enough time for my thesis I will try to get rif of them.
